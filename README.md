### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a student athlete at Denison University.
I am majoring in Data Analytics with a concentration in Sports Psychology. 
I hope to one day work in a Major League baseball organization. 
I am currently involved in Mission34 and DSAAC on campus outside of playing on the varsity baseball team.
I have experience with Python, R and SQL.
